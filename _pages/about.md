I am a *Postdoctoral Research Scholar* at the [WeLight Lab](https://hku.welight.fun), the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I have a broad interest in **Computational Optics**, currently with a particular focus on **Optical Simulation**, **Light Shaping**, **Computational Imaging**, **Adaptive Optics**, **Far-field Optical Microscopy (Nanoscopy)**, and **Optical Fabrication & Testing**.
