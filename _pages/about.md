I am a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at [Computational Imaging & Mixed Representation Laboratory](https://hku.welight.fun) (WeLight Lab), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk) (HKU).

I received my PhD in Optical Engineering in 2023 from [X Lab](https://www.haoxiang.ac.cn), [State Key Laboratory of Extreme Photonics and Instrumentation](http://www.moi-lab.zju.edu.cn/?lang=en), [College of Optical Science and Engineering](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/opten), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english) (ZJU). During the PhD, I was a Visiting Student Researcher at WeLight Lab in [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.eee.hku.hk) at HKU. I received my BS in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering in 2018 from [School of Physics and Optoelectronics](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/physics/), [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en) (SCUT).

I have a broad interest in **Computational Optics**, currently with a particular focus on **Optical Simulation**, **Light Shaping**, **Computational Imaging**, **Adaptive Optics**, **Far-field Optical Microscopy (Nanoscopy)**, and **Optical Fabrication & Testing**.
